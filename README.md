# Alx System Engineering Devops

This repository contains two folders, `0x00-shell_basics` and `0x01-shell_permissions`, which contain scripts for various shell basics and permissions in system engineering and DevOps.

## 0x00-shell_basics

This folder contains scripts that cover basic shell commands such as `echo`, `ls`, `cd`, `pwd`, `mkdir`, `rm`, `mv`, `cp`, `cat`, `less`, `file`, and more.

## 0x01-shell_permissions

This folder contains scripts that cover file permissions in Linux systems. The scripts introduce the basics of permissions such as `chmod`, `chown`, and `chgrp`, and how to use them to set file permissions and execute permission-based commands. 

Feel free to explore and use the scripts in this repository to learn and improve your system engineering and DevOps skills.
